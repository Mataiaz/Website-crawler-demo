First download this as a zip file and extract the folder.

Then if you want to check more than 1 specific website, make a excel file that is formated the same way
as the file called "exampleExcel" with the domains listed under "Domain".

Then just write in the name of your file when the program asks for it.

If you simple want to test the program quickly you can just run with the file called "exampleExcel".

Also to start the program just double click the jar file
